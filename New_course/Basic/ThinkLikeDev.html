    <h1 id="G">Set goals</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>Setting goals : Imagining goal, having a roadmap,...</li>
        <li>Always make sure i understand the code I'm tapping to train my brain</li>
        <li>Reinfurcing my knowledge while learning, don"t being in hurry and boost the confidence</li>
        <li>Coding on my own, find ideas and build it/copy other sites. No fear of stress. Be carefull of "tutorial hell"</li>
        <li>I shouldn't judge my code, and just keep going, at the worst case, I can refactor my code later.</li>
        <li>Do not loose motivation and always compare to other developers. We are always learning all the time.</li>
        <li>Find people to explain the process. Best way of learning is to teach. Share project, try to do a blog</li>
        <li>Go on 100daysofcode, codenewbie, webdev on TWITTER</li>
        <li>Couple of courses doesn't make you a good web dev, it's promordial to go deeper by ourself</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The thing is to CODE, CODE, CODE,... The only way to get better and better. Try to find people to
        learn with. Keep challenging myself... It's gonna worth it !
    </p>


    <h1 id="Sol">Solving problems !</h1>

    <p>In 4 steps ! At first, we need to stay calm, slow down and don't jump into problems without solutions.
        Take logical and rational approach
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Do I 100% understand the problem ? What are the goals, objectives ?I have to understand everything</li>
        <li>Divide and conquer : break big problems into a lot of sub/smaller problems. To do that, I need previous problem solve</li>
        <li>Make a lot of research and do not hesitate to find solutions to our problems.</li>
        <li>Make pseudo-code to us to understand before giving it to machine language.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 id="Deb">DEBBUGGING</h1>

    <p>A bug is a defect in computer programm.. Everyone is making bugs, thats normal
        and should be consider as normal !<br/>
        To debug, we have to be aware of it ! In order to do it, we need automated test.
        <br/>source of bug :<ul>
            <li>manual error</li>
            <li>compatibility with browsers</li>
        </ul>
        We need debug software and fix the problem. and prevent to spread it <br/>
    Different stage :
    <ul>
        <li>1. identify the bug</li>
        <li>2. Find where is the problem</li>
        <li>3. Fix  the problem</li>
    </ul>
    (btw, it's possible to print all element from an object with the command console.table(array))
</p>
